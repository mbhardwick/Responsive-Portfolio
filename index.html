            <img src="assets/images/graduation1.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Maribeth Hardwick">

            <p>I was born and raised in Seattle and currently live in the Ravenna neighborhood with my partner and our
                cat Schnookie. After high school, I spent several years as part of the fourth-generation operating my
                family's Seattle-based hardware store--Hardwick's. My Great-Grandpa Charlie started the business in 1932
                by selling the furniture from his real estate office that closed due to the Great Depression. It's been
                located in the U-District for over 85 years!</p>

            <p>Every day at Hardwick's was different from the last. I gained experience in a variety of different areas
                involved with running a small retail business, while also learning trade skills and developing an
                interest in woodworking.</p>

            <p>It was a tough decision to leave but my time there helped me develop the courage to move out of my
                comfort zone and I have since graduated from the University of Washington with a BA in History and a
                minor in Comparative Religion.</p>
